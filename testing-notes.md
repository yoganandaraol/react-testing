React Testing


* `create-react-app` makes jest available to the projects globally 

* `test` and `expect` are methods which are available globally (no need to import any libraries)

TDD - Test Driven Development

* TDD follows - Red Green Testing technique
* In TDD, 
    * first **Red** phase, test cases written to fail for the fucntionality provided on the bare-bones structure of component.
    * second **Green** phase, build the component to fulfill the test cases
    * third **Refactor** phase, alter the core components to optimise code without failing test cases.
